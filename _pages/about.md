About Me
I am an undergraduate Software Engineering student at Addis Ababa University, expected to graduate in 2025.

Currently, I serve as the Head of Community Education at A2SV, where I help nurture the next generation of tech talent. I'm passionate about AI and am excited to be part of a one-year research program under the mentorship of Hellina Hailu Nigatu.
