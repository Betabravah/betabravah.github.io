As part of a team of three, I contributed to the development of Gebeta | ገበታ, a mobile app designed to empower individuals with personalized dietary recommendations. My role involved working on the algorithm that tailors recommendations based on users' health status, weight, height, age, gender, and other personal characteristics. The app uses content-based recommendation and collaborative filtering methods to provide users with tailored guidance on their dietary choices. I collaborated closely with my teammates to ensure the app delivered accurate, user-centric recommendations to help individuals make informed decisions about their health and nutrition.
